/**
 * SeahorseSet:
 * @parent: The parent #GtkObject
 *
 * A subset list of the keys in the SeahorseContext.
 *
 * - Used all over by various views to narrow in on the keys that they're
 *   interested in.
 * - Originally was going to be called SeahorseView (database parlance) but
 *   that's far too confusing with overloaded terminology.
 * - Uses a SeahorseObjectPredicate to match keys.
 * - Sends out events when keys get added and removed from it's view. Or a
 *   key in the view changes etc...
 *
 * Signals:
 *   added: A key was added to this keyset.
 *   removed: A key disappeared from this keyset.
 *   changed: A key in the keyset changed.
 *   set-changed: The number of keys in the keyset changed
 *
 * Properties:
 *   count: The number of keys
 *   predicate: (SeahorseObjectPredicate) The predicate used for matching.
