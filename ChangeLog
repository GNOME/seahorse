    SeahorseContext is now a global singleton. Keys are owned by the 
    SeahorseContext. SeahorseKeyset provides a filtered view on the key 
    list. SeahorseKeySource's add keys to the context. Operations only valid
    on GPG/PGP keys now only accept those key types or key sources. More 
    abstraction to allow different types of keys.
