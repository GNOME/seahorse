      Passwords and Keys is a GNOME application for managing encryption keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Passwords and Keys you can create and manage PGP keys, create and manage SSH keys,
      publish and retrieve keys from key servers, cache your passphrase so you
      don’t have to keep typing it and backup your keys and keyring.
