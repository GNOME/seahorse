/** 
 * SeahorseSSHSource: A key source for SSH keys. 
 * 
 * - Derived from SeahorseSource
 * - Lists all the keys in ~/.ssh/ by searching through every file.
 * - Loads public keys from ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and ~/.ssh/other_keys.seahorse
 * - Adds the keys it loads to the SeahorseContext.
 * - Monitors ~/.ssh for changes and reloads the key ring as necessary.
 * 
 * Properties:
 *  ktype: (GQuark) The ktype (ie: SEAHORSE_SSH) of keys originating from this 
           key source.
 *  location: (SeahorseLocation) The location of keys that come from this 
 *         source. (ie: SEAHORSE_LOCATION_LOCAL)
