    <desc>What is the key fingerprint? Why is it important? How can I check

  <title>Key fingerprint</title>

  <p>The fingerprint of a key is a unique sequence of alphabets and numbers
  that identifies the key. Just like the thumbprints of two different people,
  the fingerprints of two different keys can never be identical. The
  fingerprint is the best way to identify a particular key.</p>

  <p>A key has several properties like the name and email of the key owner,
  key type, key expiration date and so on. When you are searching for a public
  key and you find multiple keys with the same properties, the only way to
  identify the key you are looking for is to compare the fingerprints of the
  two keys with the fingerprint of the key you require.</p>

  <p>It is the fingerprint of a key that is verified when you try to login to
  a remote computer using <link xref="what-is-ssh-key">SSH</link>. While
  signing a <link xref="what-is-pgp-key">PGP</link> key, you must always check
  the key fingerprint to ensure that you are signing the correct key.</p>

  <title>Fingerprints on <app>Passwords and Keys</app></title>

    <p>You can look at the fingerprint of a key on
    <app>Passwords and Keys</app> by checking the properties of the key.</p>

    <steps>
      <title>To check the fingerprint:</title>
        <item>
          <p>Select the key of your choice.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>Right click the key and select
	  <gui style="menuitem">Properties</gui>.</p>
	</item>
        <item>
          <p>In the new dialog, select the <gui>Details</gui> tab.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>You can see the fingerprint of the key on the left hand side.</p>
        </item>
    </steps>

  <!-- stefw: Suggest documenting that the key fingerprint is the
  only way to uniquely tell the difference between two keys.

  Two keys may have the same name and description. The label or name
  is no guarantee that the key represents the person described in the label.

  The way to guarantee that you have a given key is to compare the
  fingerprint with the person who owns the key.

  For SSH keys this is done when you initially connect to a server.

  For PGP keys this is usually done through the web of trust. Where someone
  you know signs a key, and vouches that the key with a given fingerprint
  is owned by the person noted on the label.
