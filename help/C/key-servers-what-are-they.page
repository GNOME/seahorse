  <title>What are key servers?</title>

  <p>Key servers are computers that help you to store and retrieve
  <em>Public keys</em>. When you create a new <em>Public key</em> you can
  choose to submit it to a key server. When you do this, the key server
  notifies the location of your <em>Public key</em> to other key servers. This
  makes it easier for people to import your <em>Public key</em> and use it to
  encrypt all of their communication with you. You can also import someone's
  public key if you have certain details about them like their user ID or key
  ID. There are several key servers present globally, and each of them is
  equipped with an Internet address(URL) which can be used to submit or import
  <em>Public keys</em>.</p>

  <p><app>Passwords and Keys</app> provides you with an interface to
  <link xref="keys-sync-publish">publish</link> your <em>Public keys</em> or to
  find and <link xref="keys-retrieve-remote">retrieve a remote key</link>. You
  can also use <app>Passwords and Keys</app> to sync your keys so that they are
  updated when someone signs them.</p>
