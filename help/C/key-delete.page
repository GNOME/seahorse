    <desc>Delete local copies of your keys or the keys of people you
    communicate with.</desc>

  <title>Delete an existing key</title>

  <p>If you are no longer communicating with someone, you can delete the copy
  of their key on your computer using <app>Passwords and Keys</app>. You can
  also permanently delete a key you own, provided it has never been published
  on a <link xref="key-servers-what-are-they">key server</link>.</p>

  <steps>
    <title>To delete a key:</title>
      <item>
        <p>Select the key.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Right click, and choose <gui>Delete</gui>.</p>
        <note style="tip">
          <p>You can also select <guiseq><gui style="menu">Edit</gui>
	  <gui style="menuitem">Delete</gui></guiseq> to delete the key.</p>
        </note>
      </item>
      <item>
	<p>In the new dialog that opens up, confirm the deletion by ticking
	the
	<gui style="checkbox">I understand that this secret key will be	permanently deleted</gui>
	checkbox, and press the
	<gui style="button">Delete</gui> button to finish.</p>
      </item>
  </steps>

  <note style="important">
    <p>When you delete a key that has been published on a key-server, you
    delete only the local copy of the key on your computer. The
    deleted key can still be retrieved from a key server and used to encrypt
    messages to you. You can also
    <link xref="keys-import">import</link> the deleted key from a
    key server if you wish to restore it. Such a key can be prevented from
    being used only when it
    <link xref="key-expired">expires</link> or when you
    <link xref="key-disabling">revoke</link> it.</p>
