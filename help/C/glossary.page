    <title>Encryption</title>
      <p>Encryption is the process of making your important files and data
      unreadable to anyone but the intended recipient. When you encrypt your
      data, it becomes a scrambled sequence of numbers and letters.  Encryption
      is done by someone who is sending a protected file, or sending a message
      in a protected conversation.</p>

    <title>Algorithm</title>
      <p>An algorithm is a sequence of steps used to encrypt or decrypt your
      data.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
    <title>Decryption</title>
      <p>Decryption is the process of retrieving the original text from the
      encrypted message or file. It is done by the receiver of the protected
      file or communication. Encrypted messages cannot be understood without
      decrypting them first.</p>

    <title>Plaintext</title>
      <p>Any data or file that is not encrypted, and can therefore be read by
      anyone who can access it, is called plaintext.</p>
