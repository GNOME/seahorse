    <desc>A keyring is used to group related passwords and keys.</desc>

  <title>What is a keyring?</title>

  <p>Much like a keyring in real life allows you to keep certain sets of keys
  together, a <em>keyring</em> in <app>Passwords and Keys</app> allows you to
  keep passwords and keys in separate groups.</p>

  <p>You may find this feature useful if you want some keys to be available
  when you log in, but other keys to only be avaible if you enter a password
  for that particular keyring.</p>

  <note>
    <p>By default, <app>Passwords and Keys</app> uses just one keyring to
    store all of your passwords and keys.</p>
  </note>

  <!-- stefw: is this page really necessary, at least with this title?
    Ideally we would remove the terms 'GNOME keyring' from the user
    interface of seahorse. As far as the user is concerned his/her passwords
    are stored by the password manager: seahorse.

    There are some concepts to describe about creating additional keyrings
    for different passwords, and how some keyrings can be unlocked automatically
    whereas the user may want to keep others locked, and only unlock them
    when they want to look inside.
