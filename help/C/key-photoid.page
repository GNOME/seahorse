  <title>Attach your photo to an existing key</title>

  <p>You can attach a photo ID to your PGP keys so that everyone can verify the
  ownership of your keys after looking at your photo. Though a key with an
  attached photo will provide a slightly better level of security than a key
  with no photo, checking the photo on a key is not as safe as checking the
  <link xref="key-fingerprint">fingerprint of the key</link> because anyone
  having your photos can create a key with your photo ID while the key
  fingerprint cannot be mimicked.</p>

  <note style="info">
    <p>Unlike the restrictions in <app>GPG</app>, the photo you want to
    upload need not be in the <file>JPEG</file> format. <app>Passwords and
    Keys</app> lets you upload your photo in <file>png</file>,
    <file>jpg</file> and several other common image formats.</p>
  </note>

  <steps>
    <title>To attach a photo ID:</title>
      <item>
        <p>Select the PGP key to which you want to attach a photo ID.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
	<p>Right click on the chosen key and select
	<guiseq><gui style="menuitem">Properties</gui>
	<gui>Owner</gui></guiseq>.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
	<p>Click on the button marked with a <gui style="button">+</gui> on
	the left hand side to add a photo.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Select the photo of your choice from anywhere on your computer.</p>
        <note style="info">
          <p>The photos you select should be small in size, preferably about
	  120 by 150 pixels. Since a photo ID is always attached to its key, a
	  large photo will increase the key size and slow down all operations
	  that use the key. <app>Passwords and Keys</app> resizes large photos
	  to the optimal size after asking for your confirmation.</p>
        </note>

        <p>Click <gui style="button">Close</gui> to finish.</p>
      </item>
