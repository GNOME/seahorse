    <desc>Delete local copies of your keys or the keys of people you
    communicate with.</desc>

  <title>Delete an existing key</title>

  <p>If you are no longer communicating with someone, you can delete the copy
  of their GnuPG key on your computer using <app>Passwords and Keys</app>. You
  can also permanently delete a key you own, provided it has never been
  published on a key server. Deleting a GnuPG key deletes both the public key
  and the secret key.</p>

  <steps>
    <title>To delete a key:</title>
    <item>
      <p>Select the key.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Right click, and choose <gui>Delete</gui>. Alternatively you can also
      select <guiseq><gui style="menu">Edit</gui>
      <gui style="menuitem">Delete</gui></guiseq> to delete the key.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>In the new dialog, confirm the deletion by ticking the
      <gui style="checkbox">I understand that this secret key will be permanently deleted</gui>
      checkbox, and press the <gui style="button">Delete</gui> button to
      finish.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <note style="important">
    <p>When you delete a GnuPG key that has been published on a key server, you
    only delete the secret key in the GnuPG keypair because a copy of the
    public key will still be present on some key server. This means that
    someone can <link xref="pgp-retrieve-remote">retrieve</link> the public key
    from a key server and use it to encrypt messages to you but you will not be
    able to decrypt those messages with the corresponding secret key. To
    prevent the published key from being used, retrieve it and revoke it. The
    revoked key can then be <link xref="pgp-sync">synced</link> with a key
    server to prevent people from retrieving and using it.</p>
    <!-- or when you <link xref="misc-key-revoke">revoke</link> it.- No
    revoking feature yet for SSH keys/PGP master keys-->
