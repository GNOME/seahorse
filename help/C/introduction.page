  <title>Introduction</title>

  <p><app>Passwords and Keys</app> helps you to communicate securely over the
  Internet and keep your files and data safe. It provides extremely advanced
  mathematical methods and highly secret keys to protect your files and
  communication. Some basic terms that you may encounter while reading this
  help are:</p>

      <title>Encryption</title>
	<p>Encryption is the process of making your important files and data
	unreadable to anyone but the intended recipient. It is done by the
	sender.</p>

      <title>Decryption</title>
	<p>Decryption is the process of retrieving the original text from the
	encrypted message or file. It is done by the receiver.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Plaintext</title>
	<p>Any data or file that is readable by a recipient or a
	non-recipient.</p>
    </item>

      <title>Key</title>
	<p>A key is used to encrypt or decrypt your data. For example, if you
	wish to encrypt your personal messages by substituting every letter in
	the message with a new letter according to some substitution set you
	have, the substitution set would be a key because anyone who has the
	substitution set can decrypt your messages. <app>Passwords and
	Keys</app> uses highly complex and advanced mathematical means to
	generate a key so that it is not guessable. Keys can be

      <title>Keyring</title>
