  <title>Introduction</title>

  <p><app>Passwords and Keys</app> helps you to communicate securely over the
  Internet and keep your files and data safe. It provides advanced mathematical
  methods and secret keys to protect your files and communication. Some basic
  terms that you may encounter while reading this help are:</p>

  <terms>
    <item>
      <title>Encryption</title>
        <p>Encryption is the process of making your important files and data
	unreadable to anyone but the intended recipient. It is done by the
	sender.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Algorithm</title>
        <p>An algorithm is a sequence of steps used to encrypt or decrypt
	your data.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Decryption</title>
        <p>Decryption is the process of retrieving the original text from the
	encrypted message or file. It is done by the receiver.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Plaintext</title>
        <p>Any data or file that is not encrypted, and therefore understood by
	anyone who can access it, is called plaintext.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Key</title>
        <p>A key is used to encrypt or decrypt your data. For example, if you
	wish to encrypt a personal message by substituting every letter in the
	message with a new letter according to some substitution set you have,
	the substitution set would be a key because anyone who has the
	substitution set can decrypt your message.
	<app>Passwords and Keys</app> uses advanced mathematical means to
	generate a key so that it is not guessable. Keys can be

      <title>Keyring</title>
