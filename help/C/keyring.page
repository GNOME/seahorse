    <desc>A keyring is used to group related passwords and keys.</desc>
  </info>

  <title>What is a keyring?</title>

  <p>Much like a keyring in real life allows you to keep certain sets of keys
  together, a keyring in <app>Passwords and Keys</app> allows you to keep
  passwords and keys in separate groups.</p>

  <p>When you open <app>Passwords and Keys</app> for the first time, you will
  see keys and password grouped together. In the <gui>Login</gui> keyring, you
  may find stored passwords for GNOME applications such as <app>Web</app>,
  <app>Accounts</app> etc. The <gui>Login</gui> keyring is the default keyring
  in <app>Passwords and keys</app>.</p>

  <!-- stefw: is this page really necessary, at least with this title?
    Ideally we would remove the terms 'GNOME keyring' from the user
    interface of seahorse. As far as the user is concerned his/her passwords
    are stored by the password manager: seahorse.

    There are some concepts to describe about creating additional keyrings
    for different passwords, and how some keyrings can be unlocked automatically
    whereas the user may want to keep others locked, and only unlock them
    when they want to look inside.
