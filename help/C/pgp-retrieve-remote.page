  <title>Retrieve remote keys</title>

  <p>You may want to import the <em>Public keys</em> of people you frequently
  communicate with to make it easier to encrypt messages to them.
  <app>Passwords and Keys</app> helps you to import those keys about which you
  have specific information, like the key ID or the owner's name or email
  address.</p>

  <steps>

      <item>
        <p>Select <guiseq><gui style="menu">Remote</gui>
	<gui style="menuitem">Find Remote Keysâ€¦</gui></guiseq>.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
	<p>In the new dialog that opens up, type in any information about the
	key you wish to retrieve, in the text box next to the
	<gui>Search for keys containing</gui> label. Details like key ID, or
	the key owner's email address give more accurate results than the name
	of the key owner.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
	<p>You can additionally check which key servers must be searched in
	order to find the key you are interested in by clicking the small

	<p>When you have specified enough information, press the
	<gui style="button">Search</gui> button.</p>

	results. Select the key of your choice from the results and press the
	<gui style="button">Import</gui> button present on the toolbar to
	import the key into your keyring. You can press the
	<gui style="button">Properties</gui> button to verify information about
	the key, like the key ID, key fingerprint, level of trust, owner's
	name, etc.</p>
