/**
 * SeahorseServerSource: A base class for key sources that retrieve keys
 * from remote key servers.
 *
 * - Derived from SeahorseSource.
 * - Also includes functions for parsing keyserver URIs and mapping them
 *   to the appropriate key sources (such as SeahorseHKPSource)
 * - There's some GPGME specific stuff in here that may eventually need to be
 *   moved elsewhere.
 *
 * Properties:
 *   key-type: (GQuark) The type of keys generated (ie: SKEY_PGP)
 *   location: (gchar*) The location of keys from this key source (ie: SEAHORSE_LOCATION_REMOTE)
 *   key-server: (gchar*) The host:port of the keyserver to search.
 *   uri: (gchar*) Only for remote key sources. The full URI of the keyserver
 *        being used.
