Seahorse: a Gnome interface for GnuPG.
This describes version 0.6.1

Seahorse is a graphical interface for Gnu Privacy Guard.
Its goal is to provide an easy to use Key Management Tool,
along with an easy to use interface for encryption operations.
While not complete yet, Seahorse also strives to be integrated into the
Gnome Desktop Environment, which will allow users to perform operations
from their regular applications, not necessarily Seahorse.
The following features are currently available:
	
	* Text and File Operations:
		- Import keys
		- Export keys
		- Sign (clear sign with text)
		- Encrypt
		- Decrypt
		- Verify a signature
	* Key Management Features:
		- Export a key
		- Delete a key
		- View key properties
		- Change a key's owner trust
		- Change a key's expiration date
		- Enable / Disable a key
		- Change a key's passphrase
	* Preferences:
		- Ascii Armor
		- Default signer
